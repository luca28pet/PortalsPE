# PortalsPE PM4
A PocketMine-MP portal plugin.

Latest release: https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/PortalsPE/

Latest development phars: https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/luca28pet/PortalsPE/PortalsPE

**How to create a portal:**
- _/portal pos1_, then break the first position
- _/portal pos2_, then break the second position
- Go to where you want the destination of the portal to be, and do _/portal create portalName_

**Flags:**
Every portal has a set of flag which can modify its behaviour.
Current list of implemented flags:
- _teleport_: true/false. If false, the portal will not teleport the player to the destination, but will still execute commands (useful e.g. when you want to transfer player to another server)
- _permissionMode:_ true/false. If true, the players must have the permission _portalspe.portal.portalname_ to use the portal
- _autoload_: true/false. If true, the plugin will try to automatically load the destination world
- _commands_: the list of commands that will be executed when the player enters the portal. You can use {portal} and {player} variables which will be the portal name and the player name

See Commands section belows to see how to edit flags.

**Commands:**
- _/portal pos1_
- _/portal pos2_
- _/portal create <portal name>_
- _/portal list_: see the name of the created portals
- _/portal delete <portal name>_: deletes a portal
- _/portal flag teleport <true|false>_: enables/disables flag teleport
- _/portal flag permissionMode <true|false>_: enables/disables permission mode
- _/portal flag autoload <true|false>_: enables/disables world auto loading
- _/portal flag addcommand <a command>_: adds a command to the portal
- _/portal flag rmcommand <a command>_: removes a command from the portal
- _/portal flag listcommands_: list the commands

**Permissions:**
- portalspe.command.portal: access the main command
